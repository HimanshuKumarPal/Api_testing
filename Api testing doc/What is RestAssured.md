## What is RestAssured :- 

RestAssured is a Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful and maintainable automated tests for RESTful APIs. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and validating responses, making it easier to perform integration testing on API endpoints.

Key features of RestAssured include:

1. **DSL for Requests**: Allows you to construct HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) using a fluent interface, making the code readable and concise.

2. **Validation of Responses**: Provides built-in assertions to validate response status codes, headers, body content (JSON, XML, etc.), and more.

3. **Support for Authentication**: Supports various authentication mechanisms (basic, digest, OAuth, etc.) to simulate different authorization scenarios.

4. **Handling Cookies and Sessions**: Enables handling of cookies and sessions for scenarios requiring stateful interactions.

5. **Integration with Testing Frameworks**: Integrates seamlessly with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG, allowing API tests to be executed alongside other tests.

6. **Logging and Error Handling**: Includes logging capabilities for request/response details and provides mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.

RestAssured is widely used in automated testing for REST APIs due to its simplicity, expressiveness, and the ease with which tests can be written and maintained. It's particularly useful for API testing in Java-based projects where there's a need for comprehensive API validation and integration testing.


## Structure of Maven Project :-

A Maven project follows a specific directory structure that helps organize source code, resources, and configuration files in a standardized way. Here’s the typical structure of a Maven project along with explanations for each directory and file:

```
project-root
│
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java
│   │   │   └── package
│   │   │       └── (source files)
│   │   ├── resources
│   │   │   └── (resource files)
│   │   └── webapp (for web applications)
│   │       └── (web application resources)
│   └── test
│       ├── java
│       │   └── package
│       │       └── (test source files)
│       └── resources
│           └── (test resource files)
└── target
    └── (compiled output and build artifacts)
```

### Explanation of the Structure:

1. **`pom.xml`**: This is the Project Object Model (POM) file for Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details to build the project, such as dependencies, plugins, build profiles, and more.

2. **`src`**: This directory contains all the source code and resources for the project.

   - **`main`**: This directory contains the main source code and resources for your application.

     - **`java`**: Contains Java source files (.java) organized into packages. This is where your application’s Java code resides.

     - **`resources`**: Contains non-Java resources used by the application, such as property files, XML configuration files, etc.

     - **`webapp`** (for web applications): If your project is a web application, this directory contains resources like HTML files, JSP files, web.xml, and other static content.

   - **`test`**: This directory contains the test source code and resources.

     - **`java`**: Contains Java source files (.java) for unit tests. This mirrors the structure of the `main/java` directory but contains test-specific code.

     - **`resources`**: Contains resources required for testing, such as test-specific configuration files, test data files, etc.

3. **`target`**: This directory is where Maven stores all the compiled output, packaged JARs/WARs, and other build artifacts. It is created during the build process and typically contains subdirectories like `classes` (compiled .class files), `test-classes` (compiled test .class files), and the final artifact (e.g., `project-name.jar` or `project-name.war`).

## What is Gherkin language:-

Gherkin is a domain-specific language used in behavior-driven development (BDD) to describe software behavior without detailing how that functionality is implemented. It is used to write human-readable tests that describe the behavior of a system in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand. Gherkin syntax is simple and structured to facilitate communication between technical and non-technical team members.

## Key Features of Gherkin :-

1. **Readable by Humans and Machines**: Gherkin is designed to be easy to read by both humans and machines, enabling clear communication between all stakeholders.
  
2. **Given-When-Then Structure**: Scenarios in Gherkin are written in a Given-When-Then format:
   - **Given**: Describes the initial context of the system.
   - **When**: Describes an action or event.
   - **Then**: Describes the expected outcome.

3. **Feature Files**: Gherkin scenarios are stored in feature files, which usually have a `.feature` extension.

4. **Keywords**: Common keywords in Gherkin include:
   - **Feature**: A high-level description of a software feature.
   - **Scenario**: A concrete example of a feature's behavior.
   - **Given**: The initial context or setup.
   - **When**: The action or event that triggers the behavior.
   - **Then**: The expected outcome.
   - **And**: Used to add more Given, When, or Then steps.
   - **But**: Used to add a negative condition to a step.

## Example of Gherkin Syntax :-

```gherkin
Feature: Login functionality

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user is redirected to the dashboard

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters invalid credentials
    Then an error message is displayed
```

In this example:
- The **Feature** keyword provides a high-level description of the login functionality.
- Each **Scenario** provides a specific example of how the login functionality should behave under certain conditions.
- The **Given-When-Then** structure describes the steps for each scenario.
